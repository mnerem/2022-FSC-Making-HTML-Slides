## Making Lecture Slides in HTML
May 17, 2022 01:00 PM - 02:00 PM

Presented by: Matthew Nerem,  

Lecture slides are an essential pedagogical tool and they must be refined for a digital age. This presentation will go over how to create interactive HTML slides that take advantage of all the features available in web browsers. An HTML slide can be hosted on a webpage, directly embedded into Canvas, and will work on any web browser or smart phone. This gives students the flexibility to access lecture material however they choose to without fear of compatibility issues. The tools to make these HTML slides are open source and allows anyone to create beautiful modern lectures.
